## The Nuxt 3 useFetch Navigation Conundrum: A Deep Dive

I recently ran into an interesting challenge while working with Nuxt 3's `useFetch` composable. The issue manifested as sluggish page transitions and blocked navigation - something that was particularly noticeable on slower connections. After digging deep and even getting insight from Daniel Roe (Nuxt's lead maintainer), I wanted to share my findings and solution.

## The Initial Problem

At first, my code looked something like this:

```vue [post.vue]
<script setup>
const { data: posts } = await useFetch('/api/posts')
</script>

<template>
  <div class="posts-container">
    <h1>Latest Posts</h1>
    <div v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id" class="post-item">
      {{ post.title }}
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

Seems innocent enough, right? But this pattern was causing several issues:

1. Navigation would stall until the data fetch completed
2. Users had no visual feedback during the loading process
3. The page would appear frozen during data fetching

## The Root Cause

The core issue was the `await` keyword before `useFetch`. As Daniel Roe himself pointed out:

> "Unless you're statically generating your Nuxt site, then I would suggest not awaiting it - and instead handle displaying the loading state. I'd always prefer quicker feedback to the user, even if it means more work to handle the loading state."

This makes perfect sense when you think about it. Why block the entire navigation just to wait for data that we could be loading asynchronously?

## The Solution

Here's how I refactored the code to solve these issues:

```vue [post.vue]
<script setup>
const { pending, data: posts, error } = useFetch('/api/posts')
</script>

<template>
  <div class="posts-container">
    <h1>Latest Posts</h1>
    
    <!-- Loading State -->
    <div v-if="pending" class="loading-state">
      <LoadingSpinner />
    </div>
    
    <!-- Error State -->
    <div v-else-if="error" class="error-state">
      <p>Failed to load posts: {{ error.message }}</p>
      <button @click="refresh">Retry</button>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Success State -->
    <div v-else class="posts-grid">
      <div v-for="post in posts" :key="post.id" class="post-item">
        {{ post.title }}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

## Handling SSR Considerations

When working with SSR, we need to be extra careful about how we handle data fetching. Here's a pattern I've found to work well:

```vue [post.vue]
<script setup>
const { data, pending, error } = useFetch('/api/posts', {
  // Unique key for caching
  key: 'posts-list',
  
  // Default value to prevent undefined errors
  default: () => [],
  
  // Transform the data if needed
  transform: (response) => {
    return response.posts.map(post => ({
      ...post,
      createdAt: new Date(post.createdAt)
    }))
  },
  
  // Handle errors gracefully
  onResponseError({ response }) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch posts:', response._data)
  }
})
</script>
```

## Special Case: Static Site Generation

The one exception to the "don't await" rule is when you're doing static site generation. In this case, you actually want to wait for the data:

```vue [post.vue]
<script setup>
const { data } = import.meta.env.SSG 
  ? await useFetch('/api/posts')
  : useFetch('/api/posts')
</script>
```

## Creating a Reusable Composable

For better code organization, I extracted this logic into a composable:

```ts [composables/usePostsData.ts]
export const usePostsData = () => {
  const config = useRuntimeConfig()
  
  const { data, pending, error, refresh } = useFetch(`${config.apiBase}/posts`, {
    key: 'posts',
    default: () => [],
    onResponseError({ response }) {
      const error = new Error(response._data.message || 'Failed to fetch posts')
      showError({ statusCode: response.status, message: error.message })
    }
  })

  return {
    posts: data,
    isLoading: pending,
    error,
    refresh
  }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

1. Avoid awaiting `useFetch` unless you're doing static site generation
2. Always handle loading states to provide feedback to users
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Consider using a composable for reusable data fetching logic
5. Remember that faster feedback (even if loading) is better than a blocked UI

## Why This Matters

By removing the `await` and properly handling loading states, we've achieved:

- Faster perceived performance
- Better user feedback
- Smoother page transitions
- More resilient error handling
- Improved SSR compatibility

Remember, the goal isn't just to fetch data efficiently - it's to create a smooth, responsive user experience. Sometimes that means embracing asynchronous patterns and doing a bit more work to handle loading states properly.

## Conclusion

Daniel Roe's advice about not awaiting `useFetch` highlights an important principle in modern web development: prioritize user experience and perceived performance. While it might require a bit more code to handle loading states and errors properly, the end result is a much more polished and responsive application.

By following these patterns, you'll create Nuxt 3 applications that not only work well but feel well-crafted and professional. Your users might not notice the technical details, but they'll definitely appreciate the smooth, responsive experience.
