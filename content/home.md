As a software engineer, my passion lies in building user-centric solutions. I specialize in C#, TypeScript alongside JavaScript, and modern frameworks like ASP.NET Core, Vue.js and React. I'm also currently learning and experimenting with Rust to broaden my skills.

Beyond coding, my passion for traveling and exploring new cultures brings fresh perspectives to my projects. This unique blend of technical skills and diverse experiences allows me to deliver innovative and impactful solutions.

Whether it's solving complex problems or creating intuitive user interfaces, I always strive to deliver high-quality, impactful solutions. This balance of skills and passions enables me to make a significant contribution to the teams and projects I'm part of.
